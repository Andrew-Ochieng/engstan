# Engstan
Engstan Solutions website is an ecommerce platform that allows users to browse available products and make orders via whatsapp

## MVP

Users can browse through categories:
 [Clothings](https://engstan.vercel.app/clothings)
 [Merchandize](https://engstan.vercel.app/merchandize)

Select the item they like and add it to their cart or wishlist.
After adding to cart, the user can also increase the quantity for the particular item.
A user can also remove an item from their cart or wishlist or they can clear their cart/wishlist entirely.
The cart does reset on refresh as the project doesn't use any database at the moment.

## Future Implementation
Users can create account to enable a checkout process where the users delivery information and payment methods can be stored.
Implement  a payment system.
